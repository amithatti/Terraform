->For this we have created 3 files
  - One is for "provider"
  - One is for "resource"

File - provider:

	provider "aws"{
	   region="ap-south-1"
	   access_key="<paste the access key>"
	   secret_key="<paste the secret key>"
	}

File - resource:

	resource "aws_instance" "example"{
	   ami ="ami-0451f2687182e0411"
	   instance_type="t2.micro"
	   key_name="sample"
	   count="1"
	   tags={
	      Name="ExampleInstance"
	   }
	   user_data=file("data.sh")
	}
